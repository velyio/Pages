### *Computer Science Student* at UC San Diego.

As a programmer, my goal is to solve *real-world problems* and apply  computer science principles to create an impact on my community and environment.
I participate in bioinformatics research, I work with kids at an elementary school part-time, and during my free time I like to go hiking.

##### Fun Fact: I have a pet cat that looks like this!
